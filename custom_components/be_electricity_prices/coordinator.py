"""Data coordinator for the Belgian Electricity Prices integration.

Caches the latest supplier snapshot from disk so an offline boot can still
serve last-known prices. The coordinator ticks hourly
(UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES): each tick runs the supplier's cheap freshness
probe and only re-fetches the full card when the probe key changes, while
probe-less suppliers fall back to the SNAPSHOT_REFRESH_HOURS (24h) TTL. Per
the project's fail policy, if a refresh fails the coordinator keeps serving
the cached snapshot and surfaces a repair issue.

        Fewer than twelve months of history means the mean is taken over what

    mirroring the static-path behaviour: a user with only injection
    wired (e.g. an inverter exposing solar export but no smart-meter
    consumption sensor) still gets the injection credit recognised.

    ``historical_spots`` is required for dynamic contracts (factor*spot+
    base needs a spot per hour); hours missing from the cache are

    Quarter-hourly dynamic contracts (Engie, Cociter, EBEM, Ecofix,

    For every day from Jan 1 of the current local year up to today,
    pull that day's kWh from the recorder and multiply by the tariff
    of the month the day belongs to (archived snapshot when the
    supplier exposes one, else the current snapshot as a proxy).
    Per-day kWh × per-day tariff handles tariff transitions inside a
    month (e.g. the supplier rotates a monthly card mid-month) without
    re-querying the recorder, and matches what the user reads on a
    smart meter day by day.

    Math per day, after looking up the snapshot for that day's month:

      regime=none, mono : (d_cons + n_cons) * single
      regime=none, bi   : d_cons * peak + n_cons * offpeak
      regime=injection,
        mono : (d_cons + n_cons) * single - (d_inj + n_inj) * inj_m
      regime=injection,
        bi   : d_cons * peak + n_cons * offpeak
               - (d_inj + n_inj) * inj_m
      regime=compensation, mono :
               (d_cons + n_cons - d_inj - n_inj) * single
      regime=compensation, bi :
               (d_cons - d_inj) * peak + (n_cons - n_inj) * offpeak

    Compensation netting happens once over the YTD total at the end
    (clamped at zero), matching how the Walloon annual meter readout
    actually settles -- a day of over-injection can offset a later day
    of higher consumption.

    Plus fees: the supplier yearly fixed fee and the Flemish energy
    fund are summed per archived month using each month's snapshot
    (so a supplier indexation that lands mid-year is honoured for the
    months it applies to), pro-rated by ``days_in_month_in_ytd /
    days_in_year`` so the YTD total still grows uniformly across the
    calendar year. The Walloon prosumer fee follows the same per-month
    walk against each month's DSO overlay. The running bill grows day
    by day instead of jumping to the full annual on Jan 1.

    ``inj_m`` is each month's snapshot's ``injection.current`` (the
    printed monthly indicative).

    **Time-of-Use contracts** (Engie Empower Flextime, Luminus
    SmartFlex) take a per-hour path: the recorder's hourly kWh deltas
    are billed against ``compute_breakdown`` at each local hour, so
    the energy component picks the supplier's TOU slot rate while the
    network component still follows the user's DSO mode. Reads either
    ``CONF_CONSUMPTION_KWH`` (single totals) or the day+night register
    pair via the recorder's hourly statistics; partial register
    wiring is rejected so a missing band can't silently undercount.

    **Dynamic contracts** (Cociter Dynamique, Eneco Power Dynamic,
    OCTA+ Dynamic, etc.) replay historical hourly ENTSO-E spots from
    the coordinator's persistent cache (filled lazily by
    ``_ensure_historical_spots``). Each past kWh is then billed at
    its actual ``factor*spot+base`` rate via ``compute_breakdown``,
    same code path as the live current_price. Hours with no spot in
    the cache (cold start before the backfill, or a gap left by an
    ENTSO-E publication outage) are skipped rather than zeroed; the
    caller still gets the fees-only floor when the cache is entirely
    empty.

    Returns ``None`` only when there is no meter input wired at all
    AND no snapshot to show fees against. In every other case the
    function returns a number, falling back to the fees-only floor
    rather than exposing ``unknown`` to the user.

    The whole year is recomputed from scratch on every coordinator tick
    by design: today's cost grows each hour, and prior days are NOT safely
    immutable between ticks (a late ENTSO-E spot fill or a backfill
    correction changes a past day's rate). Memoizing prior-day totals
    would risk serving a stale YTD; the full replay is O(hours-in-year)
    pure arithmetic (~100 ms by December), which is negligible at the
    hourly update cadence, so keep it simple.

    ``breakdown`` is an optional diagnostic out-dict. When passed (only the
    live coordinator does; the compare / backfill callers leave it ``None``),
    the static per-day branch records the YTD and today kWh totals, the
    pre-clamp raw energy term and the fees floor into it, so the
    current_year_cost sensor can surface them as attributes. This piggybacks
    on the walk already happening here rather than reading the recorder twice.
    It stays empty for the dynamic / spot-monthly / TOU (hourly) branches,
    which don't produce daily kWh totals.

# ---- snapshot serialization for the HA Store ----------------------------------

# the new field. Loading a snapshot whose schema_version is below this
# raises in _snapshot_from_dict; async_load_persistent then discards the
# cache and the coordinator's first refresh repopulates from the supplier.
# v9: DynamicRates gained ``quarter_hourly``. Bump so a cached dynamic
# snapshot from a pre-15-min release (Engie, Cociter, EBEM, Ecofix) is
# dropped and re-fetched with the flag set, rather than lingering on the
# hourly default until the snapshot next refreshes. The probe-based
# suppliers (Cociter, EBEM, Ecofix) would otherwise keep the stale flag
# for weeks, until their next monthly card changes the probe key.
# v10: OCTA+ Dynamic was missed by the v9 sweep; it indexes on the
# 15-minute Epex spot and now sets ``quarter_hourly`` too. Bump so a
# cached OCTA+ dynamic snapshot is dropped and re-fetched with the flag
# set rather than lingering on the hourly default.
# v11: snapshots gained supplier_prosumer_eur_per_kva_year (Cociter's
# compensation-regime PV forfait). Bump so a cached Cociter Variable
# snapshot is re-fetched with the forfait parsed instead of None.
# v12: InjectionRates gained per-slot peak/transition/offpeak (Engie
# Empower Flextime's per-slot feed-in tariff). Bump so a cached Flextime
# snapshot is re-fetched with the triplet instead of the flat single rate.
# v13: the July 2026 Eneco cards dropped the "/ VALORISATIE" suffix from
# the injection heading, so 0.8.3 parsed every Eneco injection to None and
# cached it. 0.8.4 fixed the anchor but probe-based freshness keeps serving
# that stale None until Eneco republishes. Bump so the mis-parsed snapshot
# is dropped and re-fetched with the injection block populated.
# v14: added the SpotMonthlyRates energy kind (expert custom monthly-average
# supplier) and the InjectionRates.floor_at_zero flag. Bump so a cached
# snapshot from before the field existed is dropped and rebuilt with it.
# v15: VariableRates gained formula_factor / formula_base (numeric BELIX-style
# coefficients) so a variable contract with a contract start date re-prices its
# signing cohort against the current month's mean. Bump so a cached variable
# snapshot from before the fields existed is dropped and re-parsed with them.
