"""Long-term-statistics backfill for Belgian Electricity Prices.

Populates the recorder's hourly statistics for this entry's price
sensors over an arbitrary date range so the Energy dashboard and the
Statistics graph card can show price history that predates the entry's
first live update tick.

Reads the same data sources as the live coordinator (per-month tariff
cards via :func:`_snapshot_for_month`, ENTSO-E historical spots via the
coordinator's persistent cache) and pushes ``mean`` rows through
:func:`async_import_statistics` keyed on each sensor's entity id.

Two entry points:

* :func:`backfill_range` -- service-call path. Always runs over the
  requested range; with ``clear=True`` deletes the range first so a
  user who fixed their tariff card can redo a window.
* :func:`backfill_if_missing` -- automatic one-shot called from
  ``async_setup_entry``. Probes the recorder for statistics at the Jan
  1 anchor and only runs when none exist, so we don't redo the work on
  every HA restart.

    """Write cumulative state/sum rows for ``current_year_cost`` over ``hours``.

    Mirrors the live :func:`_compute_current_year_cost` engine but
    produces one running-total point per hour instead of one
    end-of-day number, so the recorder can render the YTD bill as a
    growing line on the Energy dashboard / Statistics card.

    Per-hour fee proration uses ``annual_for_this_month / hours_in_year``
    (vs. the live ``days_in_ytd / days_in_year`` per-day proration);
    the two converge at end-of-day, but the hourly variant gives a
    smoother in-day curve. Per-month tariff archives are honoured the
    same way as in the live path.

    ``current_year_cost`` is a cumulative ``TOTAL`` sensor that resets on
    Jan 1. ``hours`` MUST stay within a single calendar year, anchored at
    that year's Jan 1: the loop accumulates monotonically from the first
    hour and (when ``emit_from`` is set) only writes rows on/after it, so
    a mid-year backfill still carries the correct year-to-date sum. The
    sum must not be reset mid-series -- the recorder derives the Energy
    dashboard's change as ``sum - prev_sum`` and ignores ``last_reset``
    for imported statistics, so a drop back to ~0 would render as a large
    spurious negative cost. The caller therefore anchors on Jan 1 of the
    *end* year and never spans a year boundary here.

    Returns a per-statistic-id row count (one entry max). Skips
    silently when the sensor isn't registered (auto path firing
    before platform setup completes).
